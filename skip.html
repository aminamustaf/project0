            <p>Hello, I love you! I am so excited you're here! I just want to be everybody's friend. My name is Skip and, when my family adopted me, I was a 10 year old Golden Retriever. I spent 2 beautiful years with them before passing, and I knew how loved I was.</p>
            <p>Although I was stubborn on walks and liked to stop in the middle of intersections, I was a very good boy. Champ was my very best friend, and before we got him we had a bunny named Doodles around. He was so cute and I loved playing with him and Champ. I can't wait to see them again one day!</p>
