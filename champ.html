        	<p>Hi everybody, my name is Champ. I am a 7 year old Norwegian Elkhound. I was adopted by my family when I was 2 years old. I had a pretty rough life before then. My past owners always kept me outside and treated me poorly, so I was a bit anxious opening up to my new family. </p>
        	<p>I can say now that I am super comfortable in my home with my pack. I joined the family when Skip and Doodles were around! I really miss them but I am glad we got Eevee last year so I have a new friend to play with! I don't think she liked me at first because of my loud bark, but we play together all the time now!</p>
